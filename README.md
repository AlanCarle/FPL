# FPL
This whole thing is mainly intended to store code I have written while using the fantasy premier league API.

As of time of of writing, if you download the 3 main files and stick them in the same folder, you can run fplAPI_menu.py and a tkinter menu will open up for you to download various fpl API things from.

You may need to pipinstall some modules.

Note: If somehow, someone stumbles across this and tried to run it, but encounters some issues, do let me know and I will see if I can fix them.
